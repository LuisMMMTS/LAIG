## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](TP1)

-  Parser with error description
-  Default cameras, materials and textures applied when none defined to allow scene rendering
-  Thorough error search and report in XML parsing with faulty node identification
-  Warnings on possible user-made mistakes such has no child or primitive in node or texture defined as null instead of clear
-  Cameras save the position where user placed them (when switching between cameras)
-  Reutilization of already defined primitives improving XML readibility and lightweightness
-  Realistic scene
-  Object oriented structure with get and set functions
