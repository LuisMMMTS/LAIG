## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](TP1)


-  Parser with error description
-  Default cameras, materials and textures applied when none defined to allow scene rendering
-  Thorough error search and report in XML parsing with faulty node identification
-  Warnings on possible user-made mistakes such has no child or primitive in node or texture defined as null instead of clear
-  Cameras save the position where user placed them (when switching between cameras)
-  Reutilization of already defined primitives improving XML readibility and lightweightness
-  Realistic scene
-  Object oriented structure with get and set functions

- Scene
  - The scene shows an airport check-in gate. It has two x-ray boxes where bags are checked, which have black curtains on either sides of them. There are also boxes where travellers belongigns are placed for the x-ray check as shown in the left mat where a laptop is placed inside the boxes, and on the right mat where the boxes are empty. In the middle of the xray boxes there is a metal detector which has a green and a red signal. After this equipment there is the airport terminal and some signal indicating where other terminals are. 
  On the floor there are social distancing signs, there are line dividers (two make two lines, one for each X-Ray box). On the left wall there are safety recommendations, a warning signs,a bathroom sign and a plane schedule board (that shows the next planes ariving/leavind/delayed.
